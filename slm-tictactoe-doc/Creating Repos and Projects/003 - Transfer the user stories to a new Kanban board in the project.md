# 003 - Transfer the user stories to a new Kanban board in the project

The user stories in the project description are:
- As a player, I want to be able to **make a move** by choosing an empty square, so that I can place my symbol on the board. (1)
- As a player, I want to be able to **see the current state** of the game, so that I can keep track of the moves made by both myself and my opponent.  (2)
- As a player, I want to **be notified when the game has ended** in a win, loss or draw, so that I can see the result of the game.  (3)
- As a player, I want to be able to **start a new game** after the current game has ended, so that I can play again. (4)

The bold parts will be chosen as titles. The parts in () are the Ids given by us.
