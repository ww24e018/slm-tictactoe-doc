This document serves as documentation for the SLM-project 'Java Game TicTacToe' and provides a walkthrough illustrating the most important steps of our development process with short textual description as well as screenshots - focussing on our usage of GitHub and application of concepts studied in the seminar rather than on the game itself.

The structure of the documentation follows the chronology of our workflow which in turn closely followed the list of tasks provided in the task description.

Regarding our collaborative process, especially in the earlier stages of the project, the majority of tasks were done together, triple programming style, to maximise knowledge gain for all team members. This is mentioned here to prevent faulty impressions that might be caused by the statistics showing that one member of the team authored significantly more commits than the other two members. This is due to the fact that their account was typically used for the tasks we tackled together.

The GitHub repository can be accessed at https://github.com/ww24e018/slm-tictactoe
The project (Kanban Board) can be accessed at https://github.com/users/ww24e018/projects/1
The .jar of our latest release of the game can be downloaded at https://github.com/ww24e018/slm-tictactoe/releases

In the process of exploring workflows and ci/cd, a test repository was created to provide a playground for quick trials that require changes to be present on the main branch. This repo can be accessed here, should it be of any interest: https://github.com/ww24e018/slm-tictactoe-test
